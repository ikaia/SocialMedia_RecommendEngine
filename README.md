# Final Term Project CSCI-5530-A

### Social Media Recommendation Engine

### Introduction
<p>The purpose of our website is to used as a recommendation system for movies that suggests content to users based on their interests and viewing habits.</p>
<p>We achieved this using a collaborative filtering technique by determining what similar users are and how to use that to send recommendations to one another.</p>

<p>The site is written in vanilla JS using the Node.js framework, while also utilizing HTML/CSS elements. </p>
